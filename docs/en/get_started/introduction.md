## Introduction

MMCV is a foundational library for computer vision research and provides the following functionalities.

- [Image/Video processing](../understand_mmcv/data_process.md)
- [Image and annotation visualization](../understand_mmcv/visualization.md)
- [Image transformation](../understand_mmcv/data_transform.md)
- [Various CNN architectures](../understand_mmcv/cnn.md)
- [High-quality implementation of common CUDA ops](../understand_mmcv/ops.md)

It supports the following systems:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS
